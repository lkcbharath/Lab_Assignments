Thomas Müller (German pronunciation: [ˈtoːmas ˈmʏlɐ]; born 13 September 1989) is a German professional footballer who plays for Bundesliga club Bayern Munich and the Germany national team. A versatile player, Müller plays as a midfielder or forward, and has been deployed in a variety of attacking roles – as an attacking midfielder, second striker, centre forward and on either wing.

Müller has been praised for his positioning, teamwork and stamina, work-rate, and has shown consistency in both scoring and creating goals[4]. He is also widely regarded as one of the best players to ever play without the ball due to his immaculate positional awareness.[5] Due to numerous strengths in his game, he is also widely regarded as one of the most complete attacking players in the game.[6]

A product of Bayern's youth system, he made his first-team breakthrough in the 2009–10 season after Louis van Gaal was appointed as the main coach; he played almost every game as the club won the league and cup double and reached the Champions League final. Müller scored 23 goals in the 2012–13 season as Bayern won a historic treble; the league title, cup and Champions League. He broke the Bundesliga record for assists by providing 21 in a season (a record in the top five leagues jointly held with Lionel Messi in La Liga) and scored 14 goals as Bayern won a second treble in the 2019–20 season.

Müller earned a call-up to the German national team in 2010. At the 2010 World Cup he scored five goals in six appearances as Germany finished in third place. He was named the Best Young Player of the tournament and won the Golden Boot as the tournament's top scorer, with five goals and three assists. At the 2014 World Cup he played a major role in helping the team win the trophy, scoring five goals and receiving the Silver Ball as the tournament's second top player and the Silver Boot as the second top goalscorer, and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI and in the Dream Team. In 2014, Müller was ranked the fifth-best footballer in the world by The Guardian.[7]

Club career
Early career
Müller played as a youth for TSV Pähl, and at the age of 10[8] he made the 50-kilometre (31 mi) journey to join local Bundesliga side Bayern Munich in 2000.[3] He progressed through the youth system and was part of the team that finished runner-up in the Under 19 Bundesliga in 2007.[9]

Bayern Munich
He made his debut for the reserve team in March 2008 when he replaced Stephan Fürstner in a Regionalliga match against SpVgg Unterhaching,[10] in which he scored. He made two more Regionalliga appearances in the 2007–08 season,[11] while continuing to play for the under-19 team. The following season, Bayern's second string qualified for the newly formed 3. Liga, and Müller established himself as a key player – he played in 32 out of 38 matches[12] and scored 15 times[13] to make him the league's fifth top scorer.[14]

2008–09 season
Müller became involved in the first-team under then manager Jürgen Klinsmann; he appeared in pre-season friendlies,[15][16] and made his full debut on 15 August 2008, when he came on as a substitute for Miroslav Klose for the last ten minutes of a Bundesliga match against Hamburger SV.[17] Despite Müller feeling that his performance did not go well,[18] he made three more Bundesliga appearances that season[12] and made his Champions League debut on 10 March 2009 when he was substituted on in the 72nd minute for Bastian Schweinsteiger in a 7–1 win over Sporting CP. He scored Bayern's last goal as they won the tie 12–1 on aggregate.[19]

In February 2009, Müller signed his first contract for the senior team, a two-year deal effective from the 2009–10 season, along with reserve teammate Holger Badstuber.[20]

2009–10 season

Müller was prepared to be loaned or even transferred away to find first-team football,[18] but when Louis van Gaal was appointed manager, both Müller and Badstuber became fixtures in the Bayern first team from the start of the season.[21] In the first few matches, Müller was a regular substitute, and on 12 September 2009, he was brought on against Borussia Dortmund and scored two goals in a 5–1 victory.[22] Three days later, he scored another brace in a 3–0 Champions League victory over Maccabi Haifa.[23] He rounded off September by being named the Bundesliga Player of the Month[24] and earned praise from his namesake, legendary former Bayern and Germany striker Gerd Müller.[25] After the Haifa match, Müller was in the starting XI for almost every match,[26] only missing one match, a Champions League match against Bordeaux, for which he was suspended,[27] because he was sent off in an earlier match against the same team.[28]

In February 2010, Müller signed a new contract with Bayern Munich through 2013.[29] During the second half of the season, Müller continued to be a regular first-team starter,[21] usually playing in a central striking role due to the availability of other wide players Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben. In April 2010, he scored the second goal in a 2–1 win against title rivals Schalke 04,[30] and in the penultimate league match of the season, he scored the first hat-trick of his career,[31] in a 3–1 win over VfL Bochum which effectively secured the German title for Bayern.[32] The title was confirmed a week later with a 3–1 win at Hertha BSC,[33][34] a match which Müller started.[35]

For the season, he played in all 34 Bundesliga matches,[36] starting 29, and recorded 13 goals and 11 assists.[21] Bayern and Müller were back in Berlin the following week, to face Werder Bremen in the final of the DFB-Pokal. Müller started the match and Bayern won 4–0 to complete the domestic double.[37] Müller scored four goals and made two assists during the competition, which made him its leading scorer for the season.[38] Bayern's season ended in pursuit of a first treble, in the 2010 Champions League Final against Inter Milan at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. It was not to be, however, as they lost 2–0, with both goals coming from Diego Milito. Müller was in the starting line-up and had a key chance just after half-time, with Bayern 1–0 down, but his shot was saved by Júlio César.[39] Müller felt particularly disappointed by this defeat,[18] but he ended his first season as a first-team player with 52 matches played and 19 goals in all competitions.[21]

In a poll conducted by the sports magazine kicker, he was voted by his fellow professionals as the best newcomer of the 2009–10 season[40] and was named in the Bundesliga Team of the Season.[41] Müller credits Van Gaal for having had the biggest part to play in his rise to success – the coach arrived with a reputation for promoting youth team players, particularly at Ajax, and consistently gave Müller his chance in the first-team, going as far to say "Müller spielt bei mir immer" ("with me, Müller will always play").[42] Müller, in return, described Van Gaal as "a genius technician" who makes players "improve every time".[18]

2010–11 season

Müller returned from his post-World Cup break to sign another contract extension, this time extending his stay at Bayern until 2015.[43] As with all of Bayern's World Cup participants, he missed much of pre-season,[44] and his first match back was the Supercup against Schalke 04 on 7 August.[45] He was named in the starting 11, and scored the opening goal in a 2–0 win.[46] Two weeks later he scored the opening goal of Bayern's league season in a 2–1 home win against VfL Wolfsburg.[47]

Müller played in every match of the first half of the season, usually as a starter,[48] but as the team struggled for results, Müller was unable to match the previous season's goalscoring exploits,[48] being dropped to the bench,[42] and even receiving a telling off from Louis van Gaal after missing an easy chance in a 2–0 defeat against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in August.[18][49] He was philosophical about this dip in form, though,[50] and after eight league games without a goal, he scored in a 4–1 win against Eintracht Frankfurt on 27 November;[51] He followed that by scoring in consecutive league and cup wins against VfB Stuttgart three weeks later.[52][53] These goals took his tally to eight goals in all competitions[48] and included a spectacular goal to open the scoring in a 2–0 Champions League victory against Roma on 15 September.[18][54]

As his team was on its winter break, Müller was left to reflect on what he described as "an almost unbelievable first year as a pro".[50] Müller began the second half of the season in good form, but was involved in an altercation with teammate Arjen Robben, who was angered when Müller showed his displeasure at a poor free-kick Robben took during a 3–1 win at Werder Bremen.[55] Müller again played in every game of the season[56] and scored 19 goals (12 in the league),[57] but the season was less successful for Bayern, as they finished third in the league,[58] and were knocked out of the DFB-Pokal in the semi-finals by Schalke 04[59] and in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League by Inter Milan; Bayern had won 1–0 at the San Siro, and Müller scored 31 minutes into the second leg to make it 3–1 on aggregate, but Inter levelled the score at 3–3 in the 88th minute to go through on the away goals rule.[60] Müller's mentor Van Gaal was increasingly criticised for inflexibility in tactical, transfer and selection policy,[61] and ultimately lost his job, being replaced with Jupp Heynckes.[62]

International career
Müller represented Germany at various youth levels, starting with the under-16s in 2004.[152] In August 2009, he was called up to the under-21 team for his debut in a 3–1 friendly defeat against Turkey.[153] He earned six caps for the under-21s and scored one goal,[154] the eighth in an 11–0 thrashing of San Marino.[155]

In October of the same year, Müller's regular appearances for Bayern's first team caused Germany national team manager Joachim Löw to publicly consider him for a call-up,[156][157] despite initial reluctance from the Bayern Munich board;[158] the following month, Müller was named in the squad for a friendly against the Ivory Coast.[159] However, this coincided with the death of national team goalkeeper Robert Enke, which led to the cancellation of a match against Chile the same week.[160] With less opportunity to try out new players, and with the under-21 team facing crucial qualifiers for the 2011 European Championship, Löw and under-21 manager Rainer Adrion felt that Müller was needed at the under-21 level, and Müller was called back into the under-21s.[161]

Müller said that he felt far more nervous during the Spain game than any he was able to play.[18] He returned to the team for the third-place playoff against Uruguay and scored the first goal, his fifth of the tournament, as Germany won 3–2 to take the bronze medals.[175] The team's success was a culmination of a series of changes made after the national team's failure at Euro 2000. The Germans emphasized a more open, attack-minded style not previously associated with Germany, and included prominent young players, including Müller, Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil.[176]

On 8 July, he scored Germany's opening goal in the 7–1 semi-final defeat of Brazil.[194] This goal was Germany's 2,000th goal in its history. Müller has now scored at least five goals in each of his first two World Cups, making him only the third player to do so (after Teófilo Cubillas and teammate Miroslav Klose).[195] With the goal, he has tied Helmut Rahn with 10 World Cup goals.[195]

On 11 July, Müller was named on the ten-man shortlist for FIFA's Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player.[196] Having played a major role in the team's World Cup triumph, Müller received the Silver Boot as the tournament's second top goalscorer with five goals,[197][198] and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI.[199]

Euro 2016
Müller featured in nine of ten matches during Germany's qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 2016, scoring nine goals as Germany topped their qualifying group to qualify for Euro 2016.[200]

Müller started in all six matches that Germany played at the Euro 2016 finals. In the quarter-final match against Italy,[201] Müller's shot was the first one to be saved in the penalty shoot-out during the tournament.[201] This was the first time Germany failed to score in a shootout since Uli Stielike missed in the 1982 World Cup.[201] Germany ended up winning the shootout 6–5.[201] Müller's poor run of form throughout the tournament hurt Germany's chances. Eventually, Müller finished the tournament without adding a goal to his name at the Euros.[202]

2018 World Cup
Müller was selected in Germany's final 23-man squad by manager Joachim Löw for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[203] Müller played in all three matches for Germany against Mexico, Sweden and South Korea. Müller started against Mexico and Sweden, but came on as a substitute against South Korea. Müller did not manage to score a goal as Germany crashed out of the World Cup at the group stage.[204]

On 5 March 2019, national team coach Joachim Löw confirmed that he would plan without Müller for the foreseeable future, along with his club teammates Jérôme Boateng and Mats Hummels.[205] Müller said after the decision that he was "angry and surprised" why Löw decided to drop him and his Bayern teammates.[206]

Style of play
Müller's role can be described as an attacking all-rounder,[176] a versatile player who is able to play in a variety of offensive positions. As he came through the youth system, he was seen primarily as a midfielder,[18] but since breaking into the first-team he has been used in more attacking roles. Both Bayern Munich and the Germany national team usually play a 4–2–3–1 formation, and Müller is most often part of the three attacking midfielders behind the central striker. He can play in any of the attacking midfield roles but usually plays in the centre for Bayern,[207] and on the right wing for Germany.[208] He has been used in a central attacking role as an out-and-out striker on occasion,[4][209][210] or even as a second striker.[4][210]

Although he lacks physical strength,[211] Müller has been praised for his maturity,[212] technique,[213] awareness, tactical intelligence, and positioning.[50][211] He has been particularly noted for his composure; Germany manager Joachim Löw said he is "impervious to pressure"[18] and former Bayern manager Louis van Gaal said he has tremendous mental strength.[50] A consistent scorer and creator of goals,[214] Müller has been lauded in the media for his intelligent movement off the ball and ability to time his attacking runs;[210][215] he describes himself as a player who can find gaps in the opposition defence but not particularly good at dribbling or one-on-ones.[18] Müller describes this role as Raumdeuter,[216][217] a term that translates to "interpreter of space" (cf. Traumdeuter, "dream interpreter"). During the 2014 World Cup, Germany manager Joachim Löw stated that Müller "is a very unorthodox player and you can't really predict his lines of running, but he has one aim and that is 'how can I score a goal?'".[218] In addition to his offensive capabilities, Müller has also been praised by pundits for his teamwork, stamina, and defensive work-rate.[4][219][220]

Personal life
Müller was born in Weilheim in Oberbayern, Bavaria.[221] He grew up in the nearby village of Pähl, which became the centre of media attention during his World Cup exploits.[222] His parents are Klaudia and Gerhard, and he has a brother, Simon, who is two and a half years younger.[222] He married his long-time girlfriend Lisa Trede, a semi-professional equestrian who works on a farm,[223] in December 2009 after being engaged for two years.[224] In June 2011, he became an ambassador for YoungWings, a charity that helps children who have suffered bereavement or trauma.[225] He is Roman Catholic.[226]
