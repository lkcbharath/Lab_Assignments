Juan de la Cruz "Juande" Ramos Cano (born 25 September 1954) is a Spanish former footballer and manager who last worked as manager of Málaga in La Liga.[1]

He is a former manager of clubs such as Real Madrid, Tottenham Hotspur and Sevilla. He is best known for his spell in Seville, which included winning the UEFA Cup as manager on two occasions with his Sevilla side, also winning the UEFA Super Cup (beating Barcelona in the final), and also winning the Copa del Rey and Supercopa de España. He has managed sides in Spain, England, Russia and Ukraine. Other notable trophies, included winning the Football League Cup at Tottenham and the Segunda División Championship with Rayo Vallecano.

He was named European Coach of the Year in 2007.

Playing career
Ramos played for Elche, Alcoyano, Linares, Eldense, Alicante and Dénia as a midfielder, until he retired due to a knee injury at the age of 28.[2]

Management career
Spain
In 1990 he started his Managerial career at Elche CF Ilicitano. He went on to manage Alcoyano, Levante, Logroñés (runner up in the Segunda División), Barcelona B, Lleida, Rayo Vallecano (where he won the Segunda División Championship), Real Betis, Espanyol and Málaga.

Sevilla
During his first season with Sevilla, he won the UEFA Cup in the final against Middlesbrough, where his side won 4–0, and also winning the UEFA Super Cup, beating European champions and fellow La Liga side FC Barcelona 3–0. In the 2006–07 season, Ramos won the UEFA Cup for the second consecutive season after a 2–2 draw against RCD Espanyol, which Sevilla won 3–1 on penalties. Ramos also led Sevilla to a third-place finish in La Liga in the 2006–07 season, which qualified them for the European Champions League for the 2007–08 season. He also won the Copa del Rey, beating Getafe CF and pipped La Liga title holders Real Madrid to the Spanish Super Cup.

Ramos claimed he turned down a "dizzying" offer to become Tottenham Hotspur manager in August 2007,[3] but ended speculation on his future at Sevilla, by stating in September 2007 that he would stay with the club until the end of the season.[4] However, following Tottenham Hotspur manager Martin Jol's sacking on 25 October 2007, Ramos was again tipped to become his replacement.[5] Ramos resigned as coach of Sevilla on 26 October 2007 and became Tottenham Hotspur manager the following day on a four-year deal, which was reportedly worth £6 million a year.[6]

Tottenham Hotspur
Ramos inherited a Tottenham side falling well short of expectations as their poor defending meant they were in the relegation zone when Ramos arrived.[7] His first game in charge of Tottenham was a 2–0 win against Blackpool in the League Cup at White Hart Lane, courtesy of goals from Robbie Keane and Pascal Chimbonda. Tottenham's form under Ramos notably improved, and the side soon climbed up to the safety of mid-table in the Premier League, but Ramos' most notable accomplishments were in the cup competitions.[citation needed] Tottenham's UEFA Cup campaign had begun badly, with Spurs losing 2–1 at home to Getafe in the first match of the group stages, a game which proved to be former manager Martin Jol's last game in charge. However, a 2–0 win over Hapoel Tel Aviv and a comeback from 2–0 down to win 3–2 against Aalborg BK, meant that Tottenham's 1–1 draw away to Anderlecht was enough to secure second place in the group, and qualification to the knock-out stages. Spurs defeated Slavia Prague and won 1–0 against PSV Eindhoven at the Philips Stadion, but were beaten on penalties.

On 18 December 2007, Spurs travelled to the City of Manchester Stadium for their League Cup quarter-final against a Manchester City who up until that point had won every home game of the season, but despite playing with 10 men for more than 70 minutes, Ramos still masterminded a 2–0 victory for Tottenham.[8] This set up a semi-final with North London rivals Arsenal. The first leg at the Emirates Stadium ended with a 1–1 draw, but the return leg at White Hart Lane saw Tottenham emphatically win 5–1. It was Tottenham's first win in the North London derby since 1999, and the biggest win for either side in the derby since 1983.[9] It also meant Tottenham made their first appearance at the newly rebuilt Wembley Stadium against Chelsea in their first cup final since 2002. Spurs started the game at a high tempo, but fell behind to a free-kick from Didier Drogba. However a second half penalty from Dimitar Berbatov took the game to extra time, where Jonathan Woodgate scored the winner to give Spurs both their first trophy since 1999 and qualification for the 2008–09 UEFA Cup.

After a promising pre-season, the 2008–09 season saw Ramos lead Tottenham to their worst ever start to a league campaign, with the team placed bottom of the table after acquiring just two points from their opening eight matches. This eventually led to Ramos being sacked on 25 October, along with assistant manager Gus Poyet, first team coach Marcos Álvarez, and club sporting director Damien Comolli, less than 24 hours before the club's next league game with Bolton Wanderers. Harry Redknapp was announced as Ramos's immediate replacement. Tottenham went on to defeat Bolton 2–0 and register their first league win of the season.

Real Madrid
On 9 December 2008, Ramos became manager of Real Madrid. He replaced Bernd Schuster, who left Madrid by mutual accord.[10] Ramos took over as manager of Real Madrid immediately before their UEFA Champions League match against Zenit St. Petersburg and the El Clásico match against FC Barcelona.[11] Ramos managed to bring Real Madrid back to the race for the Championship after achieving 52 points out of 54 possible in 18 consecutive games. However, after losing to Barcelona 2–6 at Santiago Bernabéu,[12] Madrid were defeated in 4 consecutive matches, ending 9 points behind their rivals Barcelona. His contract ended at the conclusion of the 2008–09 La Liga. He was replaced by Manuel Pellegrini in June 2009.[13]

CSKA Moscow
On 10 September 2009, Ramos signed for CSKA Moscow until December 2009, replacing Brazilian manager Zico, who left for Olympiacos.[14] Ramos said of the appointment: “I have come here to help the team in the Champions League. Our target is to advance from the group stage”.[15]

On 26 October 2009, after just 47 days in charge, Ramos was relieved of his position at CSKA by mutual consent after a 3–1 defeat at Luzhniki by Russian Premier League rivals FC Moscow a day earlier, on 25 October 2009.[16][17][18] This sacking came exactly two years after his appointment at Tottenham and 1-year and 1-day since his departure from White Hart Lane.[19][20] Krylya Sovetov coach Leonid Slutsky was appointed as Ramos' replacement.[21]

Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk
On 1 October 2010, Ramos became the manager of Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, having signed a contract for four years.[22] He left the club after the 2013–14 Ukrainian Premier League season, reportedly because of "the reluctance of his family to stay in Ukraine for a long time".[23]

It was later revealed Ramos left the Ukrainian club due to not receiving his wages under contract. Ramos eventually won a court hearing against Dnipro, for which the club was banned from the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League competition[24] and was deducted 6 points in the domestic league (2016–17 Ukrainian Premier League).[25][26]

Return to Málaga
On 27 May 2016, Ramos returns to Málaga to become the manager of Málaga CF for the second time on his career, signing a three years contract.[1]

Both the club and the coach officially agreed to part ways on 27 December 2016.[27]
